Description: Implement a shrinkage estimation for the univariate normal mean based on a preliminary test (pretest) estimator. This package also provides the confidence interval based on pivoting the cumulative density function. The methodologies are published in Taketomi et al.(2024) <doi:10.1007/s42081-023-00221-2> and Taketomi et al.(2024-)(under review).
